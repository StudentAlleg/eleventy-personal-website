## Overview
A small [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) discord bot that querys the [Steam API](https://steamcommunity.com/dev) to display an updated count of players in [Microsoft Allegiance](https://store.steampowered.com/app/700480/Microsoft_Allegiance/).

## Problem
[Allegiance](https://store.steampowered.com/app/700480/Microsoft_Allegiance/) is a small community, since it is a game now 24 years old <b>TODO make this automatic</b>. Games only happen at certain times, usually on the weekend. People have made tools in the past that let people know how many players are in game, so that interested parties do not have to go through the full process. These have become inoperative over time.
### Skills Demonstrated
* Python
* Git version control
* Request from API
* Linux
* Systems on Linux (todo correct phraseology)
