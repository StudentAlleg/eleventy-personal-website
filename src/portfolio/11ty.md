This site! This site is built using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/).

When making a site primarily as a portfolio holder and link aggregator, I wanted something that could easily handle the structure for me, so that I could spend my time on actually creating the content. Having to constantly update different parts of the project to have links be discoverable would be annoying and would let mistakes happen more often. One of the things I did while iterning on the Playable Quotes project (TODO LINK) was help create [Sample Articles](https://playable-quotes-sample-articles.glitch.me/) using Playable Quotes (TODO LINK TO PLAYABLE QUOTE). This site was created on [Glitch](https://glitch.com/), using 11ty. I was able to port the parts of it that would work in my situation and it allowed me the control I wanted, allowing things like html elements. It importantly allowed things to be simple, for example, this page was written in a .md file.

As this is an ongoing project, more things might be added or changed around.


TODO: Add 11ty and glitch assests
